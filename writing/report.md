#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

I used the interactive demo in order to conduct my analysis.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 #TODO


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 #TODO


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?


 #TODO




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

There are a lot of similarities between the sequenes. All the sequences have at least a 95% similarity to each other.


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?


I believe that we should be concenrned about possible human-to-human transmission. This is because while H5N1 has high similarity between it's versions, depending on the section that is mutating you could end up with a very different virus. Also, the Chinese version seems to already be sourced from humans. Since it is already able to make the jump to humans, it isn't a stretch to say that it would be able to soon transfer from human to human as well. While the area in the throat that it targets is too far down in the throat to be effective for human transmission, if there is enough replication there may be mutations allowing it to have an easier time transmitting from person to person.

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?

Chicken + Avian:
Length: 1751
Similarity: 1681/1751 (96.0%)
Gaps: 20/1751 (1.1%)
Score: 8205.0

China + Avian:
Length: 1776
Similarity: 1731/1776 (97.5%)
Gaps: 25/1776 (1.4%)
Score: 8575.0

Chicken + China:
Length: 1776
Similarity: 1690/1776 (95.2%)
Gaps: 45/1776 (2.5%)
Score: 8286.0
